# Overview

This is an addition to my GIS program. I added authorization through
an API to only allow authorized users.

This program uses an API to communicate between the user interface and
a database to authorize a user. Only if the user credentials match
what is in the database will the user be allowed access.

I created this program to expound upon my knowledge of WPF and C#
